      "I have had cats since I was a kid and get along really well with them as well as dogs, I want to make new friends and getting to know more friendly pets. I have had a total of 4 cats, currently there are 2 that are staying with me, all of them were strays and were rescued by me or my mom. They have become the most loving babies ever since being cared by us, and they are surely all vaccinated so there are no worries of spreading diseases to your house pets. I have experience in taking care for pets, they get on really well with me and will certainly receive good care and love.",
